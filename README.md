Our project is about creating a game with GUI.

This game based on a our previous project, that you are more then welcome to explore  https://github.com/Benitk/OOP-Assignment-Two

All the data about the robot ,the fruit ,the nodes and the edges are read from the server as Json string.

The robots on the graph need to catch the red and yellow pokeball icons as fast as they can to gain points.
The more you catch the speed of the robot is increase

There are two modes of game.
1. Automatic game play the best case that can be.
2. Manual game you choose the robots with the keyboard ,and move them with the mouse.

In the end of any game there is an option to export the game in to an KML file.
